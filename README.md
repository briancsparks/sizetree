# Never Enough

Once again, my Mac and PC were yelling at me that I was running out of
disk space, so I started to hunt down things I could kill off of my HDD
to reclaim space, as I have done 1,000 times before. But this time, I
was in the middle of trying to learn Kotlin, so...

Sizetree is a tiny utility that is intended to show me where I can
find files to kill from my hard drive.

As a developer, I am constantly making builds of my stuff, and of lots of
others stuff. It quickly adds up, and its not like I can just find one
giant file and delete it.

My suspicions are that:

* In aggregate, my node_modules folders are probably several gigs.
* I'm sure my varions `build` folders are full of gigs of '.o' (and '.obj')
on Windows.
